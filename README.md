Go to the [index notebook](index.ipynb) to view the table of contents.

## Setup instructions

1. If you don't have Python, download and install from [Miniforge](https://conda-forge.org/download/), a Python installer that also includes conda, mamba
1. Download the workshop [ZIP file](https://github.com/yoavram/DataSciPy/archive/refs/heads/amat2025b.zip).
1. Unzip the ZIP; make note of the unzipped folder location.
1. If using *VS Code* (requires additional install from [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)):

### Notes to experienced users
1. Instead of downloading the ZIP, you can clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/yoavram/DataSciPy.git`
1. Instead of updating the base environment, you can create a new environment: `mamba env create -f environment.yml -n DataSciPy`.
